# CS 4375 Machine Learning Portfolio
A portfolio for all of my assignments and projects for CS 4375 Intro to Machine Learning at UT Dallas
## Reflection on the course
After completing the CS 4375 course at UT Dallas, I finally feel comfortable with the basics of Machine Learning.
I work as a full-stack engineer and primarily focus on consumer facing products in my job. Recently, I have seen a surge in interest
from our Product and Business teams in the utilization of AI and ML to provide better experiences for our users and more insight to the company to structure our roadmap for the future. It's definetly and exciting topic now but I believe that in 4 years time, ML will almost be a requirement for any software engineer to know. Not utilziing the power for using pre-built models and training your own models will be a huge disadvantage for any company. I am glad I took this course and I am excited to continue learning more about ML and AI.
